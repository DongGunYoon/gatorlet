# **Issues our team plans to address for Sprint 2**

- Link backend work to Amazon Web Server (AWS)
- Integrate frontend and backend to create a login page that stores a user's login credentials
- Create front end for a home page, as well as pages that can be accessed by clicking on different tabs on the header, such as login, card creation and card viewing/studying pages. 
- Probably in the next sprint, add card library page with folders, but maybe start to do some of the front end for this.
- Let the user create flash cards, and display these cards. Let the user go through them and flip them (card contents may not be saved between sessions until a later sprint)
- Start to set up some of the foundation for storing card contents between sessions by saving user card libraries
