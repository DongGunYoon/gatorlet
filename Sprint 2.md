# **What issues your team planned to address**

- Link backend work to Amazon Web Server (AWS)
- Integrate frontend and backend to create a login page that stores a user's login credentials
- Create a home page and pages that can be accessed by clicking on different tabs on the header, such as a login page, card library page, card creation and study page
- Let the user create flash cards, and display these cards. Let the user go through them and flip them (card contents may not be saved between sessions until a later sprint)
- Start to set up some of the foundation for storing card contents
