# **What issues your team planned to address**

- Link backend work to Amazon Web Server (AWS)
- Integrate frontend and backend to create a login page that stores a user's login credentials
- Create more pages that can be accessed by clicking on different tabs on the header, such as a card library page, home page, and card creation and study page
- Let the user create flash cards, and display these cards and let the user flip them (card contents may not be saved between sessions until a later sprint)
- Start to set up some of the foundation for storing card contents
