# **Issues our team plans to address for Sprint 2**

- Link backend and frontend
- Allow the user to create an account and log in from the website, 
- Create front end for a home page, as well as pages that can be accessed by clicking on different tabs on the header, such as login, card creation and card viewing/studying pages. 
- Probably in the next sprint, add card library page with folders, but maybe start to do some of the front end for this.

# **Which issues were successfully completed**
- The user can create an account from the front end sign up page, and will be stopped from creating an account if an account with the given email already exists in the database
- There are multiple different webpages which can be accessed from the header, though many of them are just dummy pages for now and need work on the feature implementation and formatting

# **Which issues were not completed and why** 
- User login from the front end is not quite linked to the backend yet
- There is a lot of messy and commented front end code currently which needs to be cleaned up
- It is still not possible to create or view flash cards yet



# **List unit tests and Cypress tests for frontend**
Cypress:
- A test that goes to the home page and clicks to go to the login page
Unit tests:
- A test that checks that "Welcome to our CEN3031 Project!" is being displayed on the home page
- A test that checks the Memorly icon is being displayed in the header


# **List unit tests for backend**
