# **What issues your team planned to address**

- Have a working website that can be accessed from any computer via link

Front end:
- Have input boxes for flash card front and back sides
- Display flash card and have the option to flip it
- Have text input centered, look like a flash card
- Look into web templates
- Add color

Back end:
- Connect the frontend to the backend
- Allow users to create a profile
- Save users flashcards so they can edit at any time

# **Which issues were not completed and why** #

Front end:
- We need to understand the animations better before we can have flash cards that flip around.
- We only have one page at the moment.  We need to figure out what is needed to have more pages.
- The website looks nice but doesn't have many working buttons.  We need to look into how interacting with a button can update the cards that appear on screen.


Back end:

# **Which issues were successfully completed**

We created our website! http://flash-study.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Front end:
- The webpage is still simple but visually acceptable and neat
- The webpage has a header with buttons that we plan to link to other pages (ie login pages, about pages, etc) in the future
- We have cards that accept text input
