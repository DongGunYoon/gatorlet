#Requirements to run and use our software

Any computer capable of accessing the internet and browsing modern websites should be able to use Memorly. To do so, users will navigate to http://memorly.kro.kr/ and then will be required to create an account to continue, so any cards they create can be saved. Next, users should create a card folder to place their cards in, and when they click on the folder, they will be prompted to start off by creating multiple cards at once. After they have created these cards, they will be taken to the card view page, where they can click through the cards they have created, edit, delete and add more cards, as well as shuffle the order that the cards appear. Users can also create more folders to store their cards, and can edit and delete these foelders too.







The problem that we are trying to solve is what we see as the weaknesses of *Quizlet*. We are trying to create software that can help and teach people who are seeking information. Along with that, we are also going to support self-studying options for people seeking to memorize or prepare for tests.  

The biggest difference between *Quizlet* and **Memorly** will be the price. Currently, *Quizlet* is only providing limited features for those who use it freely, while **Memorly** will have all features available for free. We believe that every user is valuable since they could be a student, instructor, or friend. Therefore, we will minimize the profit that the service takes to maximize the user experience. That being said, **Memorly** will have limited features when compared with the full version of *Quizlet*.

Some features we hope to implement include creating a user log-in system where members can create and publish their flashcards, as well as view and use those made by other users.  While studying, users will be able to sort the order of concepts (flashcards) alphabetically or choose to shuffle them. Users can self-mark cards as 'mastered' or 'unsure' which can cause a given card to appear more or less frequently in a study session. Another is having a home page with folders for different sets of flashcards. And some others which could be implemented if time permits is fancy animations for the cards flipping over, an interface option to print a set of flashcards, and possibly adding flashcard libraries from Quizlet or the internet.
