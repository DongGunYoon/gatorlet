# Requirements to run and use our software

Any computer capable of accessing the internet and browsing modern websites should be able to use Memorly. To do so, users will navigate to http://memorly.kro.kr/ and then will be required to create an account to continue, so any cards they create can be saved. Next, users should create a card folder to place their cards in, and when they click on the folder, they will be prompted to start off by creating multiple cards at once. After they have created these cards, they will be taken to the card view page, where they can click through the cards they have created, edit, delete and add more cards, as well as shuffle the order that the cards appear. Users can also create more folders to store their cards, and can edit and delete these folders too.
