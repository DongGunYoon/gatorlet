# Gatorlet

The problem that we are trying to solve is what we see as the weakness of *Quizlet*. We are trying to create software that can help and teach people who are seeking information. Along with that, we are also going to support self-studying options for people seeking to memorize or prepare for tests.  

The biggest difference between *Quizlet* and **Gatorlet** will be the price. Currently, *Quizlet* is only providing limited features for those who use it freely, while **Gatorlet** will have all features available for free. We believe that every user is valuable since they could be a student, instructor, or friend. Therefore, we will minimize the profit that the service takes to maximize the user experience. That being said, **Gatorlet** will have limited features when compared with the full version of *Quizlet*.

Some features we hope to implement include sorting the order of concepts alphabetically or choosing to shuffle them. Another is having a home page with folders for different sets of flashcards. And some others which could be implemented if time permits is an interface option to print a set of flashcards, and possibly add flashcard libraries from Quizlet or the internet.
