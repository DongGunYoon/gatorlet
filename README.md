# Gatorlet

The problem that we are trying to clear up is what we think is the weakness of the *Quizlet*. We are trying to create software that can help and teach people who are seeking information. Along with that, we are also going to support the self-studying option for people who are willing to memorize or prepare for the test.  

The biggest difference between the *Quizlet* and the **Gatorlet** will be the price. Currently, *Quizlet* is only providing limited features for those who use it freely. However, **Gatorlet** will be free of charge to use and enjoy it. We believe that each one of the users is valuable since they could be one's student, instructor, and also buddy. Therefore, we are going to minimize the profit that the service takes to maximize the user experience.
